Please put all the files in 1 folder without anything else inside.

If it's your first time, you have to follow some instructions.
Edit pytoexe.bat and put the location of pytoexe.py where asked to.
Add the folder containing all the files to the PATH:

    Right-click on 'This PC' or 'Computer' and select 'Properties'.
    Click on 'Advanced system settings'.
    In the System Properties window, click the 'Environment Variables' button.
    In the Environment Variables window, find the 'Path' variable in the 'System variables' section, and click 'Edit'.
    Click 'New' and add the path to the directory where pytoexe.bat is located.
    Click 'OK' to close all dialogs.

Now you're done! To start using PyToExe, type in "pytoexe" without the quotes in a cmd window.
It will ask you to select the .py file you want to convert. Do that.
Then you will have to select the output folder where the .exe file will be created. Do that also.
Then just wait. It will take some time depending on the size of the file.
In case of any errors related to your antivirus, add the Python directory and python.py to a whitelist.
